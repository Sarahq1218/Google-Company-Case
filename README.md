# Google-Company-Case
Resume parser utilizing Reach JS, Express, and axios

For this project I created a resume parser with resumes that are written in an excel sheet. The project features a home-screen, upload applation screen, and a recruiter dashboard. Here, I uilized React JS, using HTML and CSS elements as well, as my front-end, and utlized express and axios as my back-end for my file uploader and parser. In reference to the name google-company-case most of the styling elements were inspired by the styles of google.
